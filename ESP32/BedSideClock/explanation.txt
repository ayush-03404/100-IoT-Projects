ESP32 Weather Display & Relay Control - How it Works

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller connected to an SSD1306 OLED display and a capacitive touch sensor to display time, weather, and control a relay.

1. Time & Date
   - ESP32 fetches local time using the `getLocalTime()` function.
   - The main page shows the current date and time including seconds.
   - Seconds are updated live every second, preventing freezing.

2. Weather
   - Weather data is fetched from the Open-Meteo API using HTTP requests.
   - JSON data is parsed using the ArduinoJson library.
   - Current weather description, temperature, day/night status, wind speed, sunrise, and sunset times are extracted.
   - Weather information is displayed on different UI pages:
       - Weather Page: Shows "Weather: Clear" or similar.
       - Wind Page: Shows wind speed.
       - Sun Page: Shows sunrise and sunset times.

3. UI Pages & Navigation
   - The interface has 5 pages:
       1. Main Page (time, date, temperature, day/night)
       2. Wind Page
       3. Weather Page
       4. Sun Page
       5. Relay Page
   - Tap the capacitive touch sensor to move to the next page.
   - The pages update dynamically as the touch sensor is used.

4. Relay Control
   - The relay can be toggled only on the Relay Page.
   - Long press the capacitive touch sensor for 8 seconds to toggle the relay.
   - A progress indicator shows how long the sensor needs to be pressed.

5. Refresh & Performance
   - Weather data is refreshed periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes).
   - UI redraws are controlled with flags to prevent freezing.
   - Main page seconds update independently to ensure live time display.

6. Hardware Connections
   - OLED uses I2C (SDA/SCL pins) to communicate with ESP32.
   - Capacitive touch sensor outputs HIGH when pressed.
   - Relay module is driven by a digital pin (HIGH activates relay).

Overall, this project integrates IoT (weather API), real-time display, touch control, and hardware relay control into a single interactive interface.
